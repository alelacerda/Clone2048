# Clone2048
This is a SwiftUI clone app of the 2048 game.

## 2048 

> 2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub.[2] The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. - _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game))_

## Motivation
